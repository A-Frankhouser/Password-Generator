# Java Script Password Generator

## Prject Description:
In this project we were given a starter code with the HTML and CSS done. What we had to focus on was writting in JavaScript. In the JavaScript section we were taksed with writting a code that would produce a random password depending on the criteria the user choose and if the user choose nothing, then it would produce a default password.

## How to use:
When you first load this page nothing will pop up. When you hit the red generate password botton then a prompt will pop up. It asks you to enter a number between 8-128. If you enter a number outside that range then it will ask you to please enter a number in that range and close the prompt. You will have to hit the generate password button again to bring up that prompt. If you enter a number within that range, then it will ask you the next questions. These questions are if you would like to include numbers, symbols, and upper/lower case letters to your password. After you have cycled through all of the sections, then it will generate your random password in the dotted outlined box!

#### Note: 
In the screenshots it says "undefined" because I am running it in a live server and cycled through the prompts many times.
